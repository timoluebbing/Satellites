# Satellites: What's the probability of being hit by a satellite?

## TO-DO
- [ ] check if data is legit with different reference location
- [ ] plot points in circle
- [ ] plot all points with openstreetmap background (px express or something else)
- [ ] kernel density estimation (parzen window)
  - [ ] Try different windows
  - [ ] Try different kernel functions
  - [ ] discrete and continous
  - [ ] Plots 
- [ ] Hypothesis testing:
  - [ ] Null: Satellites are uniformly distributed vs H1: not unifromly distributed
- [ ] Calculate proba of being hit in TÃ¼bingen
  - [ ] Define assumptions and simpifications (important for paper)
  - [ ] Define area, try out different area sizes
- [ ] Video of satellits ...
