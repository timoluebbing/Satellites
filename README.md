Data Literacy Project Repository

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

We have created 3 experiments inside the exp folder. You can find all plots and experiments here:
 - [exp_TL_MO_001_SatellitesMystery.ipynb](exp/exp_TL_MO_001_SatellitesMystery.ipynb): First notebook to solve any data capture and preprocessing challenges.
 - [exp_TL_MO_002_Starlink_Analysis.ipynb](exp/exp_TL_MO_002_Starlink_Analysis.ipynb): Second notebook for the main density and Starlink analysis.
 - [exp_SV_003_ExploreTimeComponent.py](exp/exp_SV_003_ExploreTimeComponent.py): Final notebook to create satellite animations.


```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
